# Depgraph Resolver Deployment

This repository contains a basic Docker compose setup for the required infrastructure to host a Depgraph Resolver.

The processing can be started and stopped with a simple `docker compose up/down -d` (while developing, you might consider using a `--remove-orphans` flag as well).
When you run the application, two folder will appear in your current working directory, which represent two different *types* of volumes, which

1) The `data` folder will contain the data folders for all services that are running.
This data is derived and can be regenerated. For simplicity, several folders are merged into a single subfolder `progress`, but a production deployment should split this up into multiple folders to make it easy to remove (and recompute) temporary results for individual services.
2) The `caches` folder contains original data that is downloaded from the internet, like the maven index files or the local .m2 folder.
This folder can become big, but it will never change and re-downloading the same files over and over would be a waste, so it should be kept locally.

To regenerate all data for whatever reason, just remove the `data` folder and restart the docker compose setup.
